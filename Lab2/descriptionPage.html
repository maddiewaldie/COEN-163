        <h1>Waste Management Application</h1>
        <h2>My Idea</h2>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>My application will serve as a guide to find proper waste disposal sites (trash cans, recycling bins), as well as a guide on what waste goes in which bin.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Web-app features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Map of Trash Cans & Recycling Bins in the Area
                <ul>
                    <li>Ability to find trash / recycling bins in the area</li>
                    <li>Ability to report trash / recycling bins</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li>VR Camera: To scan trash and display whether it goes in the recycling or landfill</li>
            <li>Resources page about waste management in California</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Web-app operation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When the user opens the app, they're brought to the main view, which is a map of the waste disposal bins in the area. If they want to find a recycling bin, for example, they could tap on a pin and figure out where the nearest recycling bin is. If the user knows where a recycling bin is, they could add it to the app. Additionally, if someone has trash they want to throw away, they could use the app to scan their trash and have the app analyze where to dispose of it.</li>
        </ul>
